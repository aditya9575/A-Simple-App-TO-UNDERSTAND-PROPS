Now to see the functionality of transfering the data from parent to child all you need to do is alter the import statement for <Parent> component in the app.js file


And while on the side of seeing the functionality of transfering the data from child to parent you will see a text set as "default" and a button 
to press to see the text ->"default" change to red
